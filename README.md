The purpose of this program is to allow two players to compete against each other in a text-based version of Connect 4.
After each player types in their name, they may choose to play on a 4-by-4 or 5-by-5 grid. Then, each player alternates entering the slot (i.e. “1 2” for row 1, column 2) they would like to play.
However, they must still adhere to the rules of Connect 4, meaning certain slots cannot be played (nothing that is outside of the grid, has already been played, or is not on top of another played slot).
Once a player connects 4 in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, they win and the game ends. If the entire grid is filled before a player wins, then no one wins the round and the game ends.
The user will have the option of playing again with the same players, starting a new game with different people, or exiting the game.
The program will also keep track of how many games each player from the start of the program has won.
